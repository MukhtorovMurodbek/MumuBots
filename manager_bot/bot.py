"""ManagerBot -- the private one, for the owner only.

The other four bots in the family each serve the public and each answer to
their own owner-only commands. ManagerBot serves exactly one person and
answers for all of them:

  * **Watches.** Every bot stamps a heartbeat into the shared database every
    30 seconds (family_link.py). ManagerBot checks those stamps once a minute
    and messages the owner the moment one goes stale -- and again when it
    comes back. It never repeats itself while a bot stays down.
  * **Reports.** Anything a bot considers worth waking someone for -- an
    unhandled exception, a donation, a restart -- lands in family.events and
    ManagerBot forwards it as a DM within about twenty seconds.
  * **Reaches in.** /run <bot> <command> puts a job on the family command
    queue; the target bot runs it in its own process, with its own code and
    its own Telegram identity, and the answer comes back here. That is how
    /dbdump, /whois, /message and the rest work against a bot deployed on a
    machine ManagerBot cannot otherwise reach.
  * **Reads across.** One shared Postgres database with a schema per bot
    means "how many people used ConvertBot this week" is a single query, no
    matter whether ConvertBot itself is even running.

Nothing here is reachable by anyone but the ids in MBOT_ADMIN_ID. A stranger
who finds this bot gets one flat sentence and nothing else -- and the owner
gets told they turned up.

Env vars: MBOT_TOKEN, MBOT_USERNAME (no @), MBOT_ADMIN_ID (required -- with
it empty the bot refuses to start rather than run wide open), DATABASE_URL
(the shared family database), DB_SCHEMA (default "manager_bot").

# The one place a name that is not the family name is allowed to exist.
#
# Every layer of this project derives from one canonical id -- see the naming
# table in ARCHITECTURE.md -- with exactly one exception: the Telegram
# @username. One of those was chosen before the family names settled and
# cannot simply be brought into line, because a username is not a label but
# an address:
#
#   AnonBot is @mumu_chat_bot, and every inbox link anybody has ever posted
#   is https://t.me/mumu_chat_bot?start=q_<token>. Changing it does not
#   rename the bot, it breaks every one of those links, permanently, with no
#   redirect and no way to find the people holding them. That username is
#   frozen for as long as the bot has users.
#
# So rather than pretend the mismatch is not there, it is written down here
# and every form resolves. `/logs chat`, `/logs anon`, `/logs anonbot` and
# `/logs @mumu_chat_bot` all reach the same bot.
#
# This bot used to be the second exception. It was ManagerBot's predecessor
# ParentBot at @mumu_manager_bot, and the plan was to move the username to
# @mumu_parent_bot. v1.6.0 did the opposite -- the name followed the address
# rather than the address following the name -- because the username was the
# only layer with anything depending on it and the other six were free. So
# there is one exception left in the family rather than two.

# /ping -- the whole round trip, leg by leg
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# "Is it up?" was the old question and a word was a fine answer. The useful
# question is "where does the time go?", and answering that means measuring
# five separate hops on two machines whose clocks do not agree:
#
#   the phone -> Telegram -> here     network, plus however long the update
#                                     sat in Telegram's queue
#   here -> Supabase                  the INSERT that queues the command
#   Supabase -> the target bot        how fast it hears about it
#   the target bot                    its own work, including its own hop to
#                                     Supabase
#   Supabase -> here                  the answer coming back
#
# Two machines, one honest clock. Every cross-machine figure below is a
# difference between two Postgres timestamps -- created_at, claimed_at,
# finished_at, clock_timestamp() at pickup -- so none of them contains the
# difference between this host's idea of the time and Railway's. The
# per-machine figures (each end's own round trip to Supabase, and its clock
# skew against it) are measured locally at each end and reported separately,
# which is what makes "the database is slow from there" distinguishable from
# "that bot is slow".
#
# The one figure that is *not* exact is the first: Telegram stamps a message
# with whole seconds, so the phone-to-here leg is only good to about a
# second, and it is labelled that way rather than quietly presented as
# precise.

# The nightly problem report
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Everything the four bots showed anybody in the last day, in one message, at
# 22:00 where the owner is (midnight until 2.1.0). The owner: "At the end of
# the day, at around midnight by seoul/suwon time, managerbot should
# automatically send me a full reply to the report command."
#
# It is laid out by how much each line is worth reading, which is what the
# levels are for:
#
#   urgent     listed one by one, with their incidents. These have already
#              been messaged as they happened -- this is the recap, and seeing
#              the same three incidents again is the point, not a duplicate.
#   faults     grouped by bot and code with a count, because "DL-ALL-ROUTES
#              x9" is the useful shape and nine separate lines is not.
#   explained  the bot was right and said why. Until 2.1.0 this was one line,
#              "Refused — 2", which told the owner somebody had been turned
#              down when what had happened was two people forgetting to
#              swipe-reply. Now each KIND (problems.KINDS) is named for what
#              it is, with its codes, their titles and their counts -- never
#              their incidents, which nobody needs for these.
#
# Then the feedback, when the owner has asked for it here rather than as it
# arrives (/feedback).
#
# A day with nothing in it still sends, briefly. "Nothing broke today" is
# information when it arrives every day at the same time; it is only noise
# when it is the only thing that ever arrives, and the two lines above make
# sure it is not.

    (yours to say, so one update can be as many deploys as it needs)

<b>Talking to people</b>
/say &lt;bot&gt; &lt;user_id&gt; &lt;text&gt; — DM someone <i>as</i> that bot
/broadcast &lt;bot|all&gt; &lt;text&gt; — one message to everyone, <i>as</i> that bot
/whois &lt;bot&gt; &lt;user_id&gt; — look someone up through that bot
/users [hours] — active users per bot, default 24h
/feedback [instant|nightly] — what people sent with /feedback (read only: it
    names nobody, so there is nobody to answer), and whether each one reaches
    you as it arrives or with the 22:00 report

<b>Money</b>
/balance [id] [±n|=n] — see or change a credit balance
/addcredit &lt;id&gt; &lt;amount&gt; — put ⚡ into an account
/donations — paid donations per bot
/stars — ConvertBot's Stars: paid, refunded, recent

<b>The database</b>
/backup — the whole database, lossless and restorable, sent here and pinned
/dbdump &lt;bot&gt; — that bot's own tables as CSVs
/sql &lt;SELECT …&gt; — read-only query on the shared database
/decode &lt;code&gt; — what an error code means

<b>Still works, not in the menu</b>
Renamed in 1.7.0, with the old names kept so a habit does not break:
/nightly and /reports → /problems · /finishupdates → /resume ·
/errorlog, /botlog and /problemlog → /logs · /me → /status
/crashtest &lt;bot&gt; makes a bot raise on purpose, to check the alert arrives
    (no bot named crashes ManagerBot itself)

Bots: <code>{bots}</code>
Any unambiguous prefix works — <code>/logs stick</code> is fine."""
