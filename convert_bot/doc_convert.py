"""Documents: PDF, EPUB, MOBI, FB2, CBZ, XPS, DOCX, Markdown, HTML, plain
text -- and SVG, which is a document in every way that matters here.

Three libraries, all optional, all imported inside the functions that need
them so that a host without one still starts and simply does not offer those
formats (`formats.probe()` is what notices):

  PyMuPDF   opens all of the above except DOCX and Markdown, renders pages to
            pictures, extracts their text, and writes a PDF from HTML.
  mammoth   turns a .docx into semantic HTML -- headings, lists, bold, tables
            -- which PyMuPDF then lays out.
  markdown  the same trick for Markdown.
  docx      python-docx, which writes the .docx that _to_docx below builds.

## What "docx to PDF" means here, and what it does not

There is no LibreOffice in this image, so a .docx is not rendered the way
Word would render it: page breaks, columns, headers and footers, and exact
kerning are not preserved. What is preserved is the document -- its
headings, its emphasis, its lists and its tables -- reflowed onto A4. That
is the honest description and it is what the caption says, because a user who
expects a pixel-identical page and gets a reflowed one has been misled even
though the conversion "worked".

Adding LibreOffice would fix that and cost about a gigabyte of image and a
much slower cold start on every deploy, for one format pair. It is written up
in `CHANGES_v1.5.0.md` under *Not done yet* rather than done quietly.

# ---------- the dispatcher ----------

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ...and back out to Word
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The owner: "Is it possible to add conversion from pdf to word? at least the
# bare minimum with text and some images, idk."
#
# It is, and "the bare minimum" is the honest ceiling rather than a first
# step towards something better. A PDF is a description of marks on a page:
# glyphs at coordinates, with no paragraphs, no headings, no lists and no
# tables in it. Anything that hands you a Word document with those things in
# has *inferred* them, and every library that does it well -- pdf2docx and
# the commercial engines -- carries a computer-vision stack to do the
# inferring. pdf2docx alone pulls in OpenCV and NumPy, which is most of a
# hundred megabytes of image for one format pair.
#
# So this does the part that is not guesswork: PyMuPDF already groups glyphs
# into lines and blocks and reports each span's font, size and weight, and
# that is enough to write real paragraphs, bold where the PDF says bold, and
# a heading where a line is markedly larger than the page's body text. The
# pictures come out as pictures, in the order they appear. What does not
# survive is the page layout itself: columns become sequential paragraphs,
# tables become their text, headers and footers become paragraphs like any
# other, and the page breaks are the PDF's rather than Word's.
#
# The caption says all of that, because a Word document that looks nothing
# like the PDF is a bad surprise and a Word document described as a reflow is
# exactly what was asked for.

# A line whose text is this much larger than the document's usual size is
# treated as a heading. 1.25 is deliberately shy: over-calling headings in a
# long document is worse than under-calling them, because Word's navigation
# pane then fills with sentences.
