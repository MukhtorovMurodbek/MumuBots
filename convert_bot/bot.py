"""
Standalone file converter bot -- images/video/audio, priced in Telegram Stars.

Split out of the original combined sticker+convert bot (see
ARCHITECTURE.md). This bot is its own process, its own folder and its own
deployment, with no file handoffs from its siblings -- so someone coming from
@StickerBot's "convert this" pointer just re-sends the file here directly
rather than it arriving pre-loaded. The five bots do share one Postgres
database, with a schema each; family_link.py is the only code that touches
anything outside this bot's own schema. What's new here past the original
combined bot is a shared /donate flow (Telegram Stars), merged into this
bot's existing precheckout/payment handlers alongside the "convert:" ones,
plus full English/Uzbek/Russian translation of every end-user-facing string.

Commands:
  /start           - greeting + menu
  /convert         - convert a file to another format
  /formats         - every format this bot reads and writes
  /mystars         - your own Stars spending history
  /stars           - (admin only) global Stars ledger
  /recharge        - top up ⚡ credit for conversions (/donate still works)
  /en, /uz, /rus   - switch language (English/Uzbek/Russian); also asked
                     once, trilingually, on first /start

Requires: python-telegram-bot[job-queue]>=21.3, Pillow>=10.0, ffmpeg on PATH.
          Everything past images and ffmpeg -- PDFs, e-books, Word documents,
          spreadsheets, HEIC -- is an optional dependency in requirements.txt,
          and formats.py stops offering a format whose library is missing
          rather than failing when somebody picks it.
Env vars: CBOT_TOKEN, CBOT_USERNAME (no @), CBOT_ADMIN_ID (optional,
          comma-separated, gates /stars, /dbdump, /messageas and /status),
          DATABASE_URL and DB_SCHEMA
          (the shared family database, and this bot's schema in it),
          SIBLING_BOTS (see shared_features.py), CBOT_API_ID /
          CBOT_API_HASH (files over 20 MB, see big_files.py),
          LOCAL_BOT_API_URL / LOCAL_BOT_API_MODE / CONVERT_MAX_FILE_MB (see
          convert_utils.py).
          Every performance/cost knob has a working default and is documented
          in .env.example.
