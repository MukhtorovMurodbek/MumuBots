"""Translation strings for ConvertBot's end-user-facing text (English,
Uzbek, Russian). Deliberately duplicated per bot -- same "no shared files
between bots" independence as shared_features.py -- but the STRINGS content
here is specific to this bot's own commands and flows.

Admin-only output (/stars, /dbdump, /status) is intentionally NOT
translated -- only the bot owner reads it, same reasoning as
downloader_bot's i18n.py.

The keys below split into two groups:
  - "Shared" keys (donate flow, sibling-bot blurb) exist under the exact
    same names in every bot's i18n.py, since shared_features.py is
    duplicated byte-identical across the family and calls t() with these
    names regardless of which bot it's running in.
  - Bot-specific keys, everything below the shared block, for this bot's
    own bot.py/convert_utils.py strings only.
