"""The conversion queue, and what happens to the credit.

A conversion used to run inside the handler the format button called. Every
bot in this family has python-telegram-bot process updates one at a time --
on purpose: album batching depends on the parts of an album being handled in
the order they arrive -- so a four-minute conversion of a 200-megapixel photo
held the whole bot for four minutes. Nobody else's button did anything, and
the next tap failed outright with "query is too old", because Telegram gives
a button fifteen seconds to be answered.

So the handler now decides and enqueues, and the work happens here, in a task
of its own:

  one conversion at a time per person, in the order they asked;
  MAX_CONCURRENT across the whole bot, because the container is sized for
  one heavy job rather than for everyone's at once;
  each one in a child process (convert_worker.py) under a time limit that is
  actually enforced, because a process can be killed and a thread cannot.

What happens to the credit is decided here too, in one place, because it is
the part that has to be right every time:

  it is taken when the conversion STARTS, not when it is queued, so removing
  a queued job costs nothing and no job waits in a queue holding somebody's
  money;
  it is not refunded if the person stops a running conversion themselves;
  it is refunded, and the person told why, whenever the conversion ends for a
  reason that is the bot's rather than theirs;
  and the owner is told as well whenever that reason is a fault -- a
  timeout, a crash, a result too big to send, a send that failed, a restart
  -- rather than a file the bot declined.

This module knows nothing about Telegram. bot.py hands it a Runner that does
the talking, and that seam is what lets tests/test_jobs.py drive the whole
policy with a fake worker and no network.
