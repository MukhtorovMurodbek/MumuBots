Anyone who taps it can send you an anonymous message right here in this chat — you won't see who they are.\nAnswer by replying to the message — swipe it, or press and hold it and choose Reply. That is how I know which conversation your answer belongs to, so it is required rather than optional: one public link means several people can be mid-conversation with you at once, and a message that doesn't say which thread it answers could reach the wrong one. Your answer shows up on their end as a real reply too.\n\nGot sent someone else's link? Tap it and write — your first message goes straight through, with your identity hidden. After that, reply to the message you're answering, exactly as the other side does. Tapping the same link again later starts a brand-new conversation, it won't continue the old one.\n\nReactions: react to a message in a conversation and the other person sees the same reaction on their copy. It shows beside my picture, not yours, so it gives nothing away. Change it or take it off and that carries over too. One reaction per message gets through, and only these:\n{reactions}\n⚠️ NOTE: Telegram Premium reactions (custom emoji) can NOT be passed on — the other person won't see them.\n\nCommands:\n/link - get your inbox link\n/conversations - your conversations, open and archived\n/which - send it as a reply to any message: which conversation is that?\n/newlink, /pause, /resume - also buttons on the /link screen\n/blocked - review who you've blocked\n/stats - the counts, which are on the /link screen too\n/donate - chip in for hosting costs (totally optional)\n/cancel - stop something I'm waiting on you for (I'll ask which)\n/feedback - suggest something or report a problem; only whoever runs these bots reads it, and they cannot reply\n/en, /uz, /rus - switch language (or /language, which asks)\n/balance - your ⚡ credit\n/paysupport - trouble with a payment\n/privacy - what I keep about you\n/terms - what I may be used for\n/deletemydata - delete everything I hold on you\n/start - what I do, and how to start\n/fullhelp - this full guide (/help - the short one)\n/archive - send it as a reply to a message to archive that conversation (every row in /conversations has the button too)\n\n⚠️ NOTE: Payments are final — Stars paid through /donate are NOT refunded, and the ⚡ credit they add can NOT be withdrawn.\n\n",
