"""The family bus: how one bot talks to ManagerBot, and how ManagerBot talks
back.

Every bot in the family (the four public ones and ManagerBot itself) keeps
this file, byte-identical, exactly like shared_features.py -- the bots stay
independent processes with independent repos, so nothing is imported across
folders. What they *do* share is one Postgres database, and this module is
the only thing that touches the parts of it that aren't a single bot's own.

Layout of that shared database:

    family.*        this file's tables -- heartbeats, events, command queue
    sticker_bot.*   StickerBot's own tables (its db.py, unchanged)
    convert_bot.*   ConvertBot's own tables
    downloader_bot.*
    anon_bot.*
    manager_bot.*    ManagerBot's own tables

One Postgres schema per bot means the four bots' identically-named tables
(user_settings, star_transactions, activity_events, ...) never collide, and
no bot's SQL had to change -- each connects with its own search_path (see
db.py's DB_SCHEMA). ManagerBot is the only process that reads across schemas.

Three things flow over this bus:

  1. **Heartbeats** -- every HEARTBEAT_SECONDS each bot stamps
     family.heartbeats with "still alive, started at X, N errors so far".
     ManagerBot decides a bot is down when that stamp goes stale, which
     works whether the bot crashed, was OOM-killed, lost its network, or
     was never started at all. No open ports, no HTTP between services.

  2. **Events** -- anything ManagerBot should tell the owner about lands in
     family.events (an unhandled exception, a startup, a donation).
     ManagerBot polls for undelivered ones and forwards them as a DM.

  3. **Commands** -- ManagerBot inserts a row in family.commands aimed at
     one bot; that bot polls for it (fast while the bus is busy, every
     FAMILY_BUS_POLL_IDLE_SECONDS otherwise), runs it, and writes the answer
     back into the same row. This is how ManagerBot
     runs another bot's owner-only commands (/status, /dbdump, /whois,
     /messageas, ...) without either process needing to reach the other
     over the network. A command aimed at a bot that is down simply stays
     pending until ManagerBot times it out and says so.

Every bot also tidies up after itself here, on a slow timer: its own
finished rows in family.commands (which carry file payloads -- a delivered
/dbdump zip is megabytes of BYTEA nobody will read again), its own delivered
events, and its own activity log. Each bot only ever deletes rows keyed to
itself, so the five processes need no coordination to do it.

Everything here is best-effort by design: if the shared database is
unreachable, the family bus goes quiet but the bot itself keeps serving its
users normally. A monitoring layer must never be able to take down the
thing it monitors.

# How a bot finds out there is a command waiting for it
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# It polls family.commands for its own pending rows. There is no push.
#
# v1.0.1 added a LISTEN/NOTIFY layer on top of the poll: a dedicated
# psycopg.AsyncConnection per channel, an asyncio task holding it open, its
# own reconnect/backoff. It was meant to turn "picked up within the poll
# interval" into "picked up in milliseconds". In practice it earned its
# reputation as the most fragile code in the family: the job that started it
# was silently misfire-dropped and never ran on any bot for two months
# (v1.1.2), and psycopg's async connection cannot run on Windows' default
# event loop at all, so it never worked on the laptop the bots are developed
# on. Both times the poll underneath carried the whole bus and nobody
# noticed. For a bus with one human operator typing /ping now and then, a
# held connection and 200 lines of reconnect logic bought a few seconds on a
# manual command. v1.1.4 deleted it.
#
# What is left is one poll, made adaptive: fast right after the bus was last
# busy, slow when it has been quiet. mark_bus_active() opens a short fast
# window; anything that expects bus traffic (a command just queued, claimed
# or finished) calls it. The result: a warm bus answers in about a second,
# and a cold one within FAMILY_BUS_POLL_IDLE_SECONDS. It behaves identically
# on a Windows laptop and on Railway, and it has no failure mode short of the
# database itself being unreachable -- which /status shows anyway.

# does not override it. A bot's main() stamps "now" before run_polling()
# starts the scheduler -- and between those two moments sits post_init: an
# advisory lock, the waitlist table, the maintenance flag and set_my_commands,
# each a round trip to a database on another continent. Several seconds, every
# time. So a run_once(when=0) job would be scheduled, silently discarded as a
# misfire, and never run (this is exactly how the old LISTEN listener stayed
# dead for two months -- see v1.1.2). `None` means "run it however late it

# The credit balance
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Everything anybody pays goes into a balance, and everything the family
# charges for comes out of one. There is exactly one rail, and it is the same
# rail for the owner as for a stranger.
#
# **A balance is credit, not Stars.** Paying Stars buys credit at a rate above
# one-for-one, so a balance shown as "⭐" would claim a person holds Stars they
# could take back out. Credit is "⚡" and Stars stay "⭐", everywhere.
#
# **Payments are final.** The owner decided there are no refunds of Stars
# payments, and every place a person pays says so before they do. The only
# credit that ever comes back is a conversion's own charge, returned to the
# balance when the bot fails it -- that is not a refund of money.
#
# How much a payment buys is a lifetime ladder, in the owner's words:
# "however many times the user recharges, the first 500 stars will give 3x and
# the next 500 gives 2x usage." Read as a multiplier on the ordinary rate, so
# every clause means something: somebody's first 500 Stars ever buy 6 ⚡ each,
# the next 500 buy 4 ⚡, and after that 2 ⚡. Across all their payments, not per
# payment -- paying 100 five times earns exactly what paying 500 once does.
#
# The part of a payment above the ordinary rate is **bonus credit** and it
# expires (FAMILY_BONUS_EXPIRY_DAYS, 90 by default); the ordinary part never
# does. "Only the bonus credit should expire" was the owner's instruction.
