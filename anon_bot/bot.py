"""
AnonBot -- one-sided anonymous inbox, 4th bot in the family (see
ARCHITECTURE.md). Anyone can grab a permanent personal link (/link) and
post it somewhere public; anyone who taps it can send them anonymous
messages here without the owner seeing who they are. The owner's identity
is never hidden -- it's their own bot chat -- only the person asking is.

The two things this bot is built around (both explicitly requested):
  1. Every message either side sends says which conversation it answers, by
     being a real Telegram reply to a real message in that conversation --
     so with a dozen different people messaging the owner in the same chat,
     there is never any doubt about where an answer is going. Exactly one
     message is exempt: a guest's opening one, which has nothing above it to
     answer. Every incoming message carries a "Reply" button, which explains
     the gesture; it is not a second way of sending, and there is no way to
     send a message that names nothing.
  2. When the owner replies, it's delivered as a genuine Telegram reply on
     the follower's end too (quoting their own earlier message) -- so it
     visibly looks like a real back-and-forth, not a wall of disconnected
     bot messages. See anon_logic.relay_content() for how.

Tapping the SAME link again always starts a brand-new conversation (a fresh
conv_number, a fresh reply-chain anchor) -- it does not continue whatever
was last open with that owner.

A reaction on a message in a conversation is put on the same message in the
other chat, by the bot -- see relay_reaction(). It shows beside the bot's
picture, so it is as anonymous as everything else here.

Commands:
  /start, /help     - greeting + how it works, the short version, with a
                       button for the full one (/help full); /start also
                       handles /start q_<token>, i.e. someone tapping a link
  /feedback         - a suggestion or a report, for whoever runs the bots
  /link             - get your own permanent inbox link
  /newlink          - reset your link (invalidates the old one)
  /pause / /resume  - stop/resume NEW conversations (open ones keep working)
  /conversations    - list your own threads, revisit one from its start,
                       archive the ones you're done with
  /which            - sent as a reply: which conversation is that message in
  /blocked          - review + undo who you've blocked
  /stats            - quick counts for your own inbox
  /donate           - support hosting costs (voluntary)
  /en, /uz, /rus    - switch language (English/Uzbek/Russian); also asked
                       once, trilingually, on first /start

# Every message either side sends has to say which conversation it answers, by
# being a real Telegram reply to a real message in that conversation. One
# message is exempt and only one: a guest's opening message, which has nothing
# above it to answer.
#
# There used to be a way past it. A message that named nothing was HELD -- the
# whole message, text and all, parked in user_data -- and offered back with a
# "Send it anyway" button. It was written to spare somebody a swipe, and it
# cost more than it saved:
#
#   It stored what people wrote. user_data is persisted to Postgres by
#   lifecycle.PostgresPersistence, so the held message's text went into the
#   database and sat there until the button was tapped or the row expired.
#   Every version of this bot's privacy notice says message content is never
#   stored. That sentence was not true while this existed, and no amount of
#   "only briefly" makes a stored message unstored.
#
#   It was a second router. The button guessed a destination -- the one
#   conversation the message could unambiguously have had -- which is the
#   guess the reply requirement exists to prevent, made by a button instead
#   of by the router.
#
# So there is no way past it now. A message that names nothing is refused, and
# refused is all: nothing is sent, nothing is kept, and the person is told
# which message to reply to instead of being told merely that they must.
#
# Pointing at it is the whole difference between a rule and an obstacle, which
# is why the refusal is sent AS a reply to the message it is asking about --
