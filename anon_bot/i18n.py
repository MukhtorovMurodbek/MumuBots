"""Translation strings for AnonBot's end-user-facing text (English, Uzbek,
Russian). Deliberately duplicated per bot -- same "no shared files between
bots" independence as shared_features.py -- but the STRINGS content here is
specific to this bot's own commands and flows.

Admin-only output (/dbdump, /status) is intentionally NOT translated -- see
build_status_text/error_summary/detect_host_environment in
shared_features.py, and bot.py's dbdump_command/status_command, left as
plain English since only the bot owner reads them.

The keys below split into two groups:
  - "Shared" keys (donate flow, sibling-bot blurb) exist under the exact
    same names in every bot's i18n.py, since shared_features.py is
    duplicated byte-identical across the family and calls t() with these
    names regardless of which bot it's running in.
  - Bot-specific keys, everything below the shared block, for this bot's
    own bot.py strings only.

Anyone who taps it can send you an anonymous message right here in this chat — you won't see who they are.\nAnswer by replying to the message — swipe it, or press and hold it and choose Reply. That is how I know which conversation your answer belongs to, so it is required rather than optional: one public link means several people can be mid-conversation with you at once, and a message that doesn't say which thread it answers could reach the wrong one. Your answer shows up on their end as a real reply too.\n\nGot sent someone else's link? Tap it and write — your first message goes straight through, with your identity hidden. After that, reply to the message you're answering, exactly as the other side does. Tapping the same link again later starts a brand-new conversation, it won't continue the old one.\n\nReactions: react to a message in a conversation and the other person sees the same reaction on their copy. It shows beside my picture, not yours, so it gives nothing away. Change it or take it off and that carries over too. One reaction per message gets through, and only these:\n{reactions}\n⚠️ NOTE: Telegram Premium reactions (custom emoji) can NOT be passed on — the other person won't see them.\n\nCommands:\n/link - get your inbox link\n/conversations - your conversations, open and archived\n/which - send it as a reply to any message: which conversation is that?\n/newlink, /pause, /resume - also buttons on the /link screen\n/blocked - review who you've blocked\n/stats - the counts, which are on the /link screen too\n/export - get a conversation back, copied here or as a document\n/donate - chip in for hosting costs (totally optional)\n/cancel - stop something I'm waiting on you for (I'll ask which)\n/feedback - suggest something or report a problem; only whoever runs these bots reads it, and they cannot reply\n/en, /uz, /rus - switch language (or /language, which asks)\n/balance - your ⚡ credit\n/paysupport - trouble with a payment\n/privacy - what I keep about you\n/terms - what I may be used for\n/deletemydata - delete everything I hold on you\n/start - what I do, and how to start\n/fullhelp - this full guide (/help - the short one)\n/archive - send it as a reply to a message to archive that conversation (every row in /conversations has the button too)\n\n⚠️ NOTE: Payments are final — Stars paid through /donate are NOT refunded, and the ⚡ credit they add can NOT be withdrawn.\n\n",

Любой, кто по ней перейдёт, сможет отправить вам анонимное сообщение прямо в этот чат — вы не увидите, кто это.\nОтвечайте ответом на сообщение — смахните его вправо или нажмите и удерживайте и выберите «Ответить». Так я понимаю, к какой беседе относится ваш ответ, поэтому это обязательно, а не по желанию: ссылка открытая, с вами могут говорить сразу несколько человек, и сообщение, которое не говорит, на что отвечает, может уйти не туда. У собеседника ваш ответ тоже появится как настоящий ответ.\n\nВам прислали чужую ссылку? Перейдите по ней и напишите — первое сообщение уйдёт сразу, а ваша личность останется скрытой. Дальше отвечайте ответом на сообщение, точно так же, как другая сторона. Если позже перейти по той же ссылке снова, начнётся новая беседа, а не продолжение старой.\n\nРеакции: поставьте реакцию на сообщение в беседе — собеседник увидит такую же на своей копии. Она стоит рядом с моей картинкой, а не с вашей, так что ничего не выдаёт. Поменяете или уберёте её — у собеседника будет так же. На одно сообщение передаётся одна реакция, и только из этого списка:\n{reactions}\n⚠️ ВНИМАНИЕ: реакции Telegram Premium (особые эмодзи) НЕ передаются — собеседник их не увидит.\n\nКоманды:\n/link - получить ссылку на свой ящик\n/conversations - ваши разговоры: открытые и в архиве\n/which - отправьте ответом на любое сообщение: скажу, из какого оно разговора\n/newlink, /pause, /resume - они же кнопки на экране /link\n/blocked - посмотреть, кого вы заблокировали\n/stats - краткая статистика, она же на экране /link\n/export - получить разговор обратно: копией сюда или документом\n/donate - помочь с расходами на хостинг (совершенно необязательно)\n/cancel - остановить то, чего я от вас жду (спрошу, что именно)\n/feedback - предложить идею или сообщить о проблеме; это прочитает только тот, кто ведёт этих ботов, ответа не будет\n/en, /uz, /rus - сменить язык (или /language — он спрашивает)\n/balance - ваш ⚡ кредит\n/paysupport - проблема с оплатой\n/privacy - что я о вас храню\n/terms - для чего можно пользоваться ботом\n/deletemydata - удалить всё, что я о вас храню\n/start - что этот бот делает и с чего начать\n/fullhelp - это полное руководство (/help - краткое)\n/archive - отправьте ответом на сообщение, и этот разговор уйдёт в архив (в /conversations такая кнопка есть у каждого разговора)\n\n⚠️ ВНИМАНИЕ: платежи окончательные — Stars, оплаченные через /donate, НЕ возвращаются, а добавленный ими ⚡ кредит НЕЛЬЗЯ вывести.\n\n',
