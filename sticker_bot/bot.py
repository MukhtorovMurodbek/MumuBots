"""
fstik-style sticker pack manager bot.

Part of a small bot family (see ARCHITECTURE.md): generic file conversion
(/convert, /mystars, /stars) lives in @ConvertBot, and Instagram/TikTok
downloading lives in @DownloaderBot. Each bot is its own process, its own
folder and its own deployment, with no shared files or file handoffs between
them -- so a clip that's too complex to compress into a video sticker just
dead-ends here with a pointer to @ConvertBot; the user re-sends it there.
The five do share one Postgres database, with a schema each; family_link.py
is the only code that touches anything outside this bot's own schema.

Commands:
  /start        - greeting + menu (also handles co-edit share links)
  /newpack      - create a new sticker set
  /addsticker   - add to an existing pack
  /mypacks      - list your packs; tap one for Add/Rename/Co-edit
  /import       - (while editing a pack) bulk-import from another Telegram
                  pack or a WhatsApp sticker pack .zip/.wastickers file
  /done         - finish the current pack-editing session
  /cancel       - stop whatever the bot is waiting on you for
  /whomade      - look up who created a pack (packs made through this bot)
  /donate       - support hosting costs (voluntary)
  /en, /uz, /rus - switch language (English/Uzbek/Russian); also asked
                    once, trilingually, on first /start

Once you're "editing" a pack (after /newpack, tapping Add on a pack, or
opening someone else's co-edit link), just send images, GIFs, videos, or
static/video stickers one after another -- each is added immediately with a
default 😭 emoji. Send emoji right after a sticker to retag it instead.
GIFs/videos are auto-converted (via ffmpeg) into Telegram's video-sticker
format; Lottie/.tgs animated stickers still aren't supported anywhere in
this bot family (needs a separate rendering pipeline neither bot has).

Requires: python-telegram-bot[job-queue]>=21.3, Pillow>=10.0, ffmpeg on PATH
Env vars: SBOT_TOKEN, SBOT_USERNAME (no @), DATABASE_URL and DB_SCHEMA
          (the shared family database, and this bot's schema in it),
          SIBLING_BOTS (see shared_features.py). Every performance/cost knob
          has a working default and is documented in .env.example.
