"""Postgres layer for DownloaderBot -- these tables are this bot's
alone. The family shares one Postgres database now, but each bot gets its
own schema in it (DB_SCHEMA below), and no bot reads or writes another's
tables; the only shared tables are `family.*`, which family_link.py owns.

Owns:
- per-user setting: whether downloaded videos get a credit caption
- per-group settings, for the groups the bot is in (groups.py): one row per
  group chat, holding only the switches, deleted when the bot leaves it
- a Telegram Stars ledger + donation-reminder cooldown, for this bot's own
  /donate flow (see shared_features.py)

Postgres was chosen (over SQLite) so this survives an ephemeral cloud
container redeploy -- see DEPLOY.md.

# --- one shared database, one schema per bot ---------------------------------
# The whole family now lives in ONE Postgres database, with a schema per bot
# (family_link.py has the full layout). DB_SCHEMA is the one this bot owns.
# Nothing else in this file had to change: every statement below is still
# written against bare table names, and search_path resolves them into this
# bot's own schema, so the four bots' identically-named tables
# (user_settings, star_transactions, activity_events, ...) never collide.
# Leaving DB_SCHEMA unset keeps the old behaviour -- "public" in a database
# this bot has entirely to itself.

# Connection-string sanity check

# Two ways of pointing a bot at a cloud Postgres fail *quietly* rather than
# loudly, so both are worth catching at startup instead of in the data:
#
#   Transaction pooling -- Supabase/Supavisor on port 6543, or PgBouncer in
#   transaction mode -- multiplexes many clients over a few server
#   connections, so per-connection startup options do not survive from one
#   transaction to the next. The pool below passes search_path as exactly
#   such an option, which means the bot would read and write "public"
#   instead of its own schema, while still heartbeating perfectly. That
#   surfaces as wrong data rather than as a broken bot, which is the worst
#   way to find out. The session pooler (port 5432) keeps one server
#   connection per client and is the right one here.
#
#   An unencoded "@" or ":" in the password splits the URL in the wrong
#   place, so libpq ends up resolving a hostname that is really the tail of
#   the password -- a DNS error that says nothing about the real cause.
#
# These warn rather than refuse: an unusual setup is the owner's business,
# and a bot that will not start is worse than one that says why it might
# misbehave.

# enthusiast -- and they are rolling windows rather than a reset at midnight,
# because a reset at midnight is an invitation to queue up against it.
#
# Donors get a larger share. Not a different bot and not a queue-jump: the

# something whose cost is a fetch and an encode. A single donation of any
# size counts, forever -- billing anybody monthly for this would cost more to
