"""Turning a pasted link into files, through whichever route is still working.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    Until v1.2.1 this bot had exactly one way to get a video: yt-dlp, running
    inside the container, fetching from the site directly. That works from a
    phone and does not work from Railway, and the difference is not the code
    -- it is the IP address. Instagram, YouTube and increasingly TikTok decide
    what to serve partly from *where* the request comes from, every cloud
    host's address sits in a published datacenter range, and those ranges get
    a login page where a home connection gets the post. v1.1.3 diagnosed this
    correctly and concluded there were two fixes, cookies or a residential
    proxy, both of which need something the bot cannot supply itself. So
    Instagram simply stopped working, and said so politely.

    There is a third option, and it is the one that holds: do not make the
    request from here at all. The "fix the embed" services and the public
    downloader APIs run their own fetching infrastructure -- their addresses,
    their cookie pools, their problem -- and hand back either a direct CDN URL
    or a copy proxied through themselves. Whether *this* container is on a
    blocked range stops mattering.

    The catch is that any one of those services is mortal. They get bought,
    rate-limited, sued (vxtiktok, as of this writing, answers every request
    with "due to a legal request, this service is no longer available"), or
    just stop resolving in DNS (ddinstagram and kkinstagram both did). A bot
    built on one of them is a bot that breaks in a month with no warning.

    Hence a chain, per platform, with the bot keeping score. Every provider is
    tried in turn until one produces media; whichever one worked is
    remembered, whichever one failed is remembered too, and a provider that
    keeps failing is moved to the back of the queue and retried more and more
    rarely instead of being taken out of service. Nothing here needs a human
    to notice a provider has died. Adding a replacement is a function and one
    line in PROVIDERS.

WHAT IS NOT SOLVED HERE
    Nothing makes a private account public, and nothing makes a deleted post
    come back. When every provider says no, the user gets one sentence saying
    which of those two kinds of "no" it looked like, not five stack traces.

    And the providers were verified from a residential connection, because
    that is where this was written. A service that answers here could still be
    challenged from Railway's range -- which is exactly the failure the health
    scoring is built to absorb: the first user to hit it pays a few seconds,
    the chain moves on, and `/providers` says what happened.

# cobalt, for the platforms with nothing else
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# cobalt (github.com/imputnet/cobalt) is an open-source downloader whose whole
# product is an API: POST a link, get back a URL that serves the file. The
# official instance wants a Turnstile token, but the project is built to be
# self-hosted, and a number of people run public instances that answer
# without one. Like the embed-fixers above, the fetching happens from *their*
# address -- and the file comes back through their `/tunnel`, so the second
# request never touches YouTube's CDN from this container either.
#
# Written in the cloud session of 2026-09-25 for YouTube, which had yt-dlp and
# nothing else: a redeploy can land on an address YouTube challenges ("sign in
# to confirm you're not a bot") and a link that downloaded the day before is
# then DL-BLOCKED. Ported here at 2.1.0 (that branch was never merged). With
# cobalt ahead of it, yt-dlp becomes what it is everywhere else -- the last
# resort, and the route that gets better if cookies or a proxy are set.
#
# Checked 2026-10-07 from a residential address: of the three default
# instances one answered, one said error.api.youtube.login and one
# content.no_valid_content. Every one is somebody's hobby server, which is why
# there are several, tried in order inside this one provider, with whichever
# answered last going first next time -- so a dead instance costs one request
# per restart rather than one per download. To use an instance of your own
# (the robust answer; a cobalt container is small), put it first in
# DBOT_COBALT_INSTANCES and its key in DBOT_COBALT_API_KEY, which is sent to
# that first instance only: a key is a secret, and the rest are strangers.
