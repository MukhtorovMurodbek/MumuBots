"""ManagerBot's own logging / crash tracking / activity tracking.

This is the monitoring half of the other four bots' shared_features.py,
copied here without the halves ManagerBot has no use for (donations, the
sibling-bot cross-promotion, i18n -- ManagerBot has exactly one user and
speaks one language). family_link.py looks for a module named either
`shared_features` or `monitoring` and uses whichever it finds, which is why
this file keeps the same function names.

Keeping ManagerBot on the same vocabulary matters: a bot that watches the
others should be watched by exactly the same machinery, so "ManagerBot has
been quietly crashing" is as visible as it would be for any of them.
