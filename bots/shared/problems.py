"""Every problem a person can run into in the family's bots, by code.

The owner asked for this in so many words: "Give every possible exception that
the user might trigger a code or a unique identifier", a "report the issue"
button beside it, and "a list or a dictionary that can decode this error
message with as much accuracy as possible." This file is that dictionary.

A CODE names a kind of problem and never changes once shipped, so a report
sent months later still decodes. An INCIDENT names one occurrence: it is made
when the message goes out, carried by the report button, and written to the
log beside what happened, so a report can be matched to its log line.

A code is shown at the end of a message as "🆔 CODE". i18n.t() appends that
line for every key in KEYS; a message assembled from several strings gets it
at its end, where it is assembled (ConvertBot's job endings, StickerBot's
sticker errors and imports, DownloaderBot's allowance message).
shared_features logs every message that ends in one, with its time and incident,
and puts a report button under the ones that are not SIMPLE. Every code also
has a LEVEL -- see the block above `reportable()` -- which decides whether the
owner hears about it now or in the nightly report.

Copied, not imported, into all five bots -- ManagerBot's /decode reads it.
Pure: no Telegram, no database, nothing that can fail at import.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How loudly a problem should be answered
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The owner, in 1.7.0: "Give priority levels for errors. The highest level
# errors should be sent to me immediately. The most important of those can be
# when a bot crashes entirely. Other errors should be visible in the report
# command."
#
# Three levels, and the line between them is *whose fault it is and how much
# of the bot it takes down*:
#
#   1 URGENT   The bot is broken, or something that had to happen did not:
#              a crash, a disk with no room left, a message that was accepted
#              and then never delivered, money taken with nothing to show for
#              it. One of these is worth a message at three in the morning
#              because waiting until midnight makes it worse.
#
#   2 FAULT    One person asked for something and the bot could not do it,
#              through no fault of theirs -- a download that failed, a
#              conversion that timed out, Telegram refusing a sticker. Worth
#              knowing about, not worth waking up for. Into the daily report.
#
#   3 EXPLAINED  The bot did exactly the right thing and told the person why
#              it could not do what they asked: a file over the limit, a
#              message that was not a reply, an expired button, an unknown
#              command. Not a fault at all, and the reason SIMPLE exists --
#              these are the problems whose own message explains them. In the
#              daily report by KIND (below), never one incident at a time.
#              (The constant is still called REFUSED; the report stopped
#              saying "refused" in 2.1.0 -- see KINDS for why.)
#
# A level-2 code can still reach the owner immediately without being promoted:
# see BURST_ESCALATION in shared_features. Fifty of the same failure in an
# hour is not fifty people having bad luck, it is a route that has gone down,
# and that is a level-1 fact assembled out of level-2 parts.

#   OTHER_SIDE  the other person's choice: blocked, paused, never started
#   PAUSED      they came while the owner had the bots paused for an update
