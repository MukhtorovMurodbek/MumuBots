"""Translation strings for StickerBot's end-user-facing text (English,
Uzbek, Russian). Deliberately duplicated per bot -- same "no shared files
between bots" independence as shared_features.py -- but the STRINGS content
here is specific to this bot's own commands and flows.

Admin-only output (/whois, /messageas, /dbdump, /status, /crashtest) is
intentionally NOT translated -- only the bot owner ever sees it, same
reasoning as downloader_bot's i18n.py.

The keys below split into two groups:
  - "Shared" keys (donate flow, sibling-bot blurb) exist under the exact
    same names in every bot's i18n.py, since shared_features.py is
    duplicated byte-identical across the family and calls t() with these
    names regardless of which bot it's running in.
  - Bot-specific keys, everything below the shared block, for this bot's
    own bot.py (plus video_sticker.py/import_utils.py error text) strings
    only.

# English lives in BOT_COMMANDS in bot.py, where the menu can be read by
# reading the file. These are the same commands for a client whose language is
# Uzbek or Russian; shared_features.publish_commands() sends one list per
# language and Telegram picks the matching one.
#
# Deliberately absent: /language, /en, /uz and /rus. Each of the three is
# written in the language it switches TO, and /language is written in all
# three at once, because they are the way back for somebody who chose the
# wrong one. Translating them would make the menu of a Russian client offer
# three lines of Russian, one of which is the only route out.
#
# A command missing from here keeps its English description rather than
# vanishing from that language's menu -- a half-translated menu is a menu
# with commands missing, and a missing command reads as a bot that cannot do
# the thing. Kept honest by tests/test_menu.py, which fails on a command that
# has no entry here and on an entry naming a command that no longer exists.
