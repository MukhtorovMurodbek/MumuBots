"""One HTTP client for the whole process, and the two ways this bot fetches
media with it.

Every fetch used to build its own `httpx.AsyncClient` inside an `async with`
-- a fresh TCP connection and TLS handshake per request, thrown away straight
after, against hosts considerably further away than the database this family
already learned that lesson on. One client, kept open, reuses connections
across requests and across users. The pool is small on purpose: this bot is
never talking to more than a handful of hosts at once.

Split out of platforms.py at v1.2.1, because resolvers.py needs the same
client and importing it back out of a module about *page scraping* had the
dependency arrow pointing the wrong way.
