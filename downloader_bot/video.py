"""The yt-dlp provider: download a video with yt-dlp so the bot can re-send it.

Since v1.2.1 this is one link in resolvers.py's chain rather than the whole
download path, and it is deliberately *last* in every chain. yt-dlp makes the
request from this container's own address, and a datacenter address is the
thing Instagram and YouTube object to -- so it is the route most likely to
come back with a login page, and the only route that gets better the moment
DBOT_<SITE>_COOKIES_FILE or DBOT_<SITE>_PROXY is set. It is also the only
route that works for YouTube at all, and the only one that muxes Reddit's
separate DASH video and audio tracks.

yt-dlp is imported lazily, inside download_video(). Importing it costs
roughly 30-40 MB of resident memory and a second of startup for its
several-hundred extractor modules, and a bot that goes a whole day without
anyone pasting a link should not be paying that the whole time. The first
download pays it once, and it stays loaded from then on.
