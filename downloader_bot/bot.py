"""
Media downloader bot -- 4th bot in the family (see ARCHITECTURE.md).

Commands:
  /start, /help   - greeting + how it works
  /caption on|off - toggle the "via @thisbot" credit caption
  /lossless on|off- send downloads as uncompressed files
  /donate         - support hosting costs (voluntary)
  /en, /uz, /rus  - switch language (English/Uzbek/Russian); also asked
                    once, trilingually, on first /start
  /providers      - owner-only: which download route is currently working

Paste a link at any time (no command needed). Instagram, TikTok, Twitter/X,
Pinterest and Reddit all go through resolvers.py, which tries several
independent ways of getting the media and remembers which ones work -- read
that file's docstring first, because the reason it exists (a datacenter IP
gets a login page where a phone gets the post) is the single most important
thing to know about this bot.

Reddit and Twitter/X keep one thing resolvers.py does not do: a post with no
media in it is rendered as a clean card image (cards.py) instead of a wall of
text, which is the actual point of "downloading" one of those.

YouTube is deliberately not mentioned in /help, /start, or the bot's command
menu (BOT_COMMANDS below) -- it is handled if pasted but never advertised. It
is also the one platform with no route but yt-dlp, so it is the one most
likely to be refusing this server on any given day; advertising it would be
promising something the bot cannot keep. Don't "helpfully" add it to the help
text later without checking with the repo owner first.

Requires: python-telegram-bot[job-queue]>=21.3, yt-dlp>=2024.1, httpx,
          Pillow, python-dotenv>=1.0
Env vars: DBOT_TOKEN, DBOT_USERNAME (no @), DBOT_ADMIN_ID (optional,
          comma-separated, gates /messageas, /dbdump, /status, /providers),
          DATABASE_URL and DB_SCHEMA (the shared family database, and this
          bot's schema in it), SIBLING_BOTS. Download limits, concurrency and
          the per-site cookie/proxy settings are documented in .env.example.
